## About

This project is about a Visual Studio Code extension that groups functionalities about logging method in Java Project. It uses a AI model trained on open-source Java projects to predict and check the log density of `.java` files and projects, helping developers understand and optimize their logging practices. It also offers the possibility to generate log advices with a large language model at line in code, for the function / method in which you are. Basics functionalities are:

- Model Training
- Log Density Analysis
- Generate Log Advice

For more details, see the [documentation](./docs/README.md).

## Features

- **Model Training**: Train the AI model using a collection of open-source Java projects.
- **Log Density Analysis**: Analyze individual Java files to determine the log density in each block of code.
- **Batch Log Density Prediction**: Obtain predicted and current log densities for multiple Java files at once.

- **Generate Log Advice**: Generate log advices with a large language model at line in code, for the function / method in which you are.
- **Get Model Info**: Get current configured model.
- **Change Model ID**: Change the configured model and download if not available locally by givving a valid model ID.
- **Change Token**: Change and set a new token (Only used for HuggingFace).
