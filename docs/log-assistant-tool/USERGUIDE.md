## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the user guide for the "Log Assistant Tool" extension, designed to suggest line of code to improve the logging density for a given Java file. This guide will help you get started with the tool.

The log assistant tool is a functionality of the log density analyzer tool that provides suggestions to improve the logging density in Java files. It uses a large language model that runs in Ollama to generate log advice at the line of code level. The tool is designed to help developers understand and optimize their logging practices.

- The extension will request ollama to generate a log advice base on the line of code wanted and the code of the method/function where the line is.
- The log advice will be inserted in the file at the line of code where the cursor was.
- The extension now asked you to confirm if the generated log advice is correct.
