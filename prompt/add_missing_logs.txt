Context: you are a tool that adds log statement for java files where they are needed. You are given a list of objects containing the files we want to add logs to. each of these objects has the following attributes: filePath: the path to the file, fileContent: The code of the file, and blocks: the blocks we identified within that file. blocks are a list of objects that have the attribute blockLineStart and blockLineEnd. These attributes tell you the start and end of the current block. 

We want you to add logs for each block within each file, at the top of the block. 

Here is the list of objects you need to use to add logs to the files : 

{blocks}

For the output, I would want you to give me a list of the files, with the new code as the modifiedFileContent attribute.

The response should be in the following json form and without any other explanations: 

{{
    [
        {
            "filePath": "", 
            "modifiedFileContent": ""
        }
    ]
   
}}
