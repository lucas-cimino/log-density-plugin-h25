Improve the following log message by fixing typos and adding more context if necessary.

Improvements may include:
1. Fix any spelling or grammatical errors
2. Add relevant context from method parameters, variable state, or execution flow
3. Ensure consistent capitalization and punctuation
4. Use clear, precise technical language appropriate for logging
5. Maintain the same log level (info/debug/warn/error) as the original
6. Preserve the original logging mechanism (same logger instance)

Do NOT modify the tone, structure, or wording unless absolutely necessary.

**If you make no changes, you MUST set `"reason": "No necessary changes needed"` in the JSON response.**

If the improved log message is *identical* to the original, the `"reason"` value must be `"No necessary changes needed"`.

The log:
{log_message}

The context:
{vscode_content}

Respond strictly in this JSON format without any other explanation:
{{
    "log_statement": "System.out.println(<log message or variable>);", 
    "reason": "how did you reason to generate the log message"
}}
