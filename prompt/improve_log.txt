Improve the following log message by fixing typos and adding more context if necessary.

Improvements may include:
- Fixing typos
- Adding missing details for clarity
- Improving phrasing for better understanding

Do NOT modify the tone, structure, or wording unless absolutely necessary.

**If you make no changes, you MUST set `"reason": "No necessary changes needed"` in the JSON response.**

If the improved log message is *identical* to the original, the `"reason"` value must be `"No necessary changes needed"`.

The log:
{log_message}

The context:
{vscode_content}

Respond strictly in this JSON format without any other explanation:
{{
    "log_statement": "System.out.println(<log message or variable>);", 
    "reason": "how did you reason to generate the log message"
}}
