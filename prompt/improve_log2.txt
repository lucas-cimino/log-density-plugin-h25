For every log in this code block (System.out.print()/.println or System.err.print()/.println), improve it by checking for errors such as:
- Typos in the log message
- Missing context in the log
- Using the wrong log type (ex: using System.out.println() when System.err.println() would be more suited because it's logging an error)

If there are no errors, don't change a thing.

The response should be in the following json form and without any other explanations: 

{
    {
    "log_statement": "System.out.println(<log message or variable>);", 
    "reason": "how did you reason to generate the log message"
    }
}
